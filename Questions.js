// Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
//SQL is a language used to query databases.
//In relational databases, the data is stored in into rows and columns.

// Why do tables need a primary key?
//Tables have primary keys that uniquely identify each row.

// What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
//Foreign keys.

// What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
//We need an intermediary table that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables.
